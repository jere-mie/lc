# 🎯 LeetCode Solutions

A collection of my personal solutions to LeetCode problems. This repository serves as a personal archive of algorithmic challenges, categorized by topic.

## 📚 Resources

To master algorithmic problem solving, I use the following resources:

*   **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** - The ultimate platform for technical interview preparation.
*   **[NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice/practice/neetcode150)** - A fantastic curated list of problems and clean video explanations.

## 📁 Structure

Problems are organized by their respective categories (e.g., Arrays & Hashing, Two Pointers, etc.). Each problem directory contains a `solution.py` with the implementation.
